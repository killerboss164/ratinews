<h1 class="finallyfirst">finalfantasy coming on pc</h1>
<p class="finalfantasy">Sony started its PlayStation conference off big—Final Fantasy big. The next Final Fantasy game is officially Final Fantasy 16,
     and it looks dark (the last line spoken in the trailer is "I'll kill you if it's the last thing I do").
      But it's still full of familiar series elements, including Chocobos, summons, and Crystals.And it's coming to PC.
      It's telling that the trailer showed the logo for Square's development team Creative Business Unit III—the VP of that department is Naoki Yoshida,
       who famously saved Final Fantasy 14 and led the MMO to enormous success over the last several years.
       There were rumors that Yoshida was helming the next mainline Final Fantasy game, and those rumors seem to now be borne out.
